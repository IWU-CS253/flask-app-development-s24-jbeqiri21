# Flaskr Plus Part 1
# Author Jon Beqiri

# Project Description

Users have the ability to assign a category to each post, and display each post's category underneath its title. Any string in this category is acceptable as provided by the user.

Users have the ability to filter posts by category, so you only see posts of the chosen category. The categories will be able to be selected from a list and will be able to return to seeing all of the previous posts after filtering without having to use the back button.

Users will be able to delete individual posts with a delete button attached to each of those individual.
